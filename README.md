## Descriptions
 I have complains about QWRTY layout.
 However, existing layouts are also not for me for some reasons.
 So I created this layout to achieve these.
- Keep HJKL and BNPF close for vim, emacs and some software use these keybindings.
- Better than QWERTY to type English and Japanese(Roma-ji).
- As much efficient as DVORAK on both languages.
- Do not keep AIUEO keys to left or right hand side like DVORAK.
- Only the middle finger should be one row up to the home row.

 But these are not goal.
- Create more efficient layout than colemak, workman, etc.
- Keep ZXCV to left bottom for shortcut.
- Reduce the usage of the ring and pinky fingers.

## TODO
- [ ] Add Japanese Description.
- [ ] Add configs for some software(xremap, ...)
- [ ] Add the KLA score is described as one of the evaluation indicators.
